# Navyatej Tummala

Master’s in Computer Science at NC State (Spring 2026) building production-grade backend systems and AI copilots.  
Most recently, I shipped an On-Call Copilot (Slack + RAG) that hit **89% Top-3 source recall** across **180 eval queries** with **~780 ms** median latency, and I have internship experience improving analytics workflows by **40%** across **50+ sources**.

## Featured Projects

### On-Call Copilot (Slack AI Agent)
RAG assistant that answers on-call questions using runbooks, postmortems, and service docs with grounded, citation-based responses.
- Hybrid retrieval (BM25 + embeddings) + cross-encoder reranking  
- **Top-3 source recall: 89%** across **180** evaluation queries  
- Containerized FastAPI microservice with Redis caching, **~780 ms** median latency  
Tech: Python, FastAPI, Slack Bolt, LangChain, Sentence Transformers, FAISS or Pinecone, Redis, Docker

### Drug Information Chatbot (GenAI Assistant)
Real-time drug and regulatory Q&A assistant using FDA data and NLP-driven dialogue handling.
- Intent classification, entity recognition, and dialogue management in Rasa  
- Secure API + refresh pipeline to keep responses current  
Tech: Python, Rasa, BERT, FastAPI, SQL, FDA API

### LLM-Driven Refactoring Research (Expertiza OSS)
LLM-assisted pipeline that analyzes design quality and generates code-linked refactoring recommendations.
- Detects SOLID, DRY, and LoD violations using prompt engineering + RAG  
- Designed evaluation metrics to quantify code-quality improvements  
Tech: Python, LangChain, RAG, Git, LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, DeepSeek, LLaMA)
